    <p >My Sitereport includes the experience I have got on studying the web development course module. Web development course is actually a new to me as I have studied the basic of web development earlier as I have done diploma in IT. I have also designed the website earlier. But earlier I have been just taught the basic of web development.
       In diploma I have actually designed the simple webiste. How the website is created using HTML and CSS. In diploma I have been asked to just I have been given website template and I have to changed that website to my own requirement. Actually I have gained I have gained alot of knowledge in that dipmloma class.
       But in my diploma class they haven't taught the basic of use of different tag. Because that class was very short period of time. In that short period of time we have to do all the things like designing the webiste. How the webiste can be edited. We have also been asked to design simple website as I have been given webiste template.
       Now coming back to my bachelor in computing course. The course module teacher has been very friendly and helpful as earlier the teacher have started the class with introduction to youself. Introductin to different topics like defination of web browser, web server, client server architecture, web designing, web programming, 
       static website, dynamic webiste. After the introduction the teacher has taught about the different tools we will be using thorught the course like github/git, basic use of command line/terminal, text editor, web development like HTML and CSS, basic of web technologies and design. First the course module teacher has taught 
       the creating of github account, we will be using google chrome browser, code editor like Sublime text and github commands. The course module teacher have taught the github mechanism, how to sign up github account and create your first repository after creating github account. After that some common use of command line/command prompt 
       on windows and creating directory and then installing sublime text editor. Now creating simple web page using some basic coommon HTML tag like html, head, title, body, paragrapgh and heading h1 to h6, etc. After creating github account and signing in we have to create first repository. After that the use of different github command 
       git clone, git status, git add, git commit and git push. After that the course module teacher have taught the basic of HTML like html, head, body, title, headings(h1 to h6), paragraph(p), anchor(a), div, font, span, table, tr, td, ul li, ol, img, strong, b, u, etc and now basic of CSS proerties like includes font-size, font-family, 
       color, background, margins, paddings, text-align, font-weight, border-radius, box-shadow, list-style, text-decoration, etc. and CSS types as well. The course module teacher has also taught us flex box, media queries, how to make website responsive, etc. After that the course module teacher have taught us about CSS properties, 
       shadows, transforms, transitions and animation. After that how to create any kinds of forms using html and css. After teaching html forms then about the grid layout or grid properties. The teacher have also asked us to regularly practice those topic which has been taught so that we can understand the use that. Also then if any problem
       arise then we can ask the course module teacher and he have also said same. So as you know without practising we cannot find any problems and teacher cannot also solve our problems. Our course module teacher were so much helpful and friendly that he have taught about the use of github more than four times or more than that. 
       In my web development course there were many ups and downs I have been faced. At first I was unable to understand most of the things like mainly css properties and their use because it was not new to kind of new to me. Because I have said earlier that we were only asked to just changed in that given design template. 
       So, it was a kind of new to me. I have faced many problems like in that github I was unable to push anything. The course module teacher have also taught me more times about github. Coming to HTML I have faced problems like using link tag, span, tr, td, strong, anchor, etc. I was unable to use these tag because honestly I didn't know the
       use of these tags. So how can I use them. The course module teacher have helped me to understand these tags and now I can use them in my own website. Coming to CSS, honestly I will tell that I didn't understand anything about CSS. How can I say the problems in CSS because from the first topic of CSS I didn't understad anything about CSS.
       Regularly I have been studying CSS so that I can understand. I have visited many websites, seen many youtube video of CSS and our course module teacher have also helped me alot. So after doing all that researches and helped from the teachers now I am able to understand whole CSS properties and how we can use them. So using many
       CSS properties I am designing this website for my portfolio.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am designing this website for my own portfolio. After serching on different plaforms like serch engine websites of many, seen youtube video,  I have made this design decisions which is unique and unknown to many websites that I have visited. I have made this design because I am making my own webiste for my portfolio. 
       So, this is just the simple design I have made. I have taken help from my course module teacher slides also. The course module teacher have taught us many things and he also have given many exercises. So by taking help from the exercises I have done, I have made this design decisions which is just simple and easy to use.
       I was very much confused in my design which color to use or which font to use. So at last I have made one decision that I will not use color in background I will use background image that I have taken from website of copyright free image. Because I find it more attrractive than the color that I have thought. 
       The references for my image I have used in my whole page is Pixabay. (2022, March 5). (Tolucreations, Ed.) [Review of Pixabay]. Retrieved from Pixabay website: https://pixabay.com/illustrations/gradient-professional-background-1761190/ as <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/gradient-professional-background-1761190/">Background Image</a>. About the font I will be using Google fonts like Zen, etc. 
       I will reference this later in my tag explaination. As I have said I have been influenced by many websites that I have seen. The link for my influenced website <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/creative/2020/03/best-portfolio-websites/">Influenced Websites</a> So this is the link for my influenced website for my portfolio.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Firstly I haven't changed anything in my website because time that I have got very limited. The course module have given so much time. But I have said I have not so much time because of my own work because I have said earlier I have been studied diploma in IT. So time were very less for me. If any changes needed I will not hegitate
       to change anything in my webiste according to the user needs. If any changes need in the near future, then please feel free to contact me in the given contact form through email.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now from the first page I will start to tell the different codes that I have used in my website. Start from the first page is simply index or home page. I have used this link rel tag to link the html document to css. I have used nav tag to set the link to navigation. I have used div class to divide the menu bar so that name should 
       come separately. I have used li tag to list the different pages name because I have five different pages. I have used img src tag to include image in my website. I have used section tag so that the document and image couldn't mix together. I have used h1 tag to give heading to my website. I have used p class tag to so that paragraph
       couldn't mix together. Now CSS I have used are box-sizing to give border-box, margin and madding. I have used font-family inside the body as Arial, sans-serif as the referencing for this is Google Fonts. (2019). Google Fonts. [online] Available at: https://fonts.google.com/. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Font</a>.

       my work. The other tag is img scr for inserting background image for my portfolio website. I have also used placeholder for placing my image properly with their width, height, etc. Now the CSS I have used in this section is someting may be similar to my first page like margin, padding, font-family, etc. I have used nav css for navigating and giving
